Email Init
==========

This is the README for the currently vapourware native IMAP email client
for the Mac, [as proposed by Brent Simmons][email_init].

I'm hoping we can use the wiki here on github to keep track of things
that come up on the mailing list.

When code actually starts to be written, I hope we can use this project
and github's bug tracker too.


Mailing List
------------

There's a brimming mailing list of smart people throwing ideas around.
